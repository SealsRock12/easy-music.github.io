          Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was a german classical composer from
          the late 18th century to the early 19th. He composed nine symphonies,
          32 piano sonatas, five piano concertos, 17 string quartets, several
          overtures, and many chamber works. He is best known for the 9th
          Symphony (famously known as Old to Joy), Fur Elise, the 5th Symphony,
          the moonlight sonata, and a few other works. His 250th birthday was
          just last year (2020) in December.

          He was born on December 16th, 1770, in the city of Bonn, Germany. But
          at that time, Germany wasn’t formed yet: the area he was born in was
          called the Holy Roman Empire. He did not do well in school, although
          he excelled in foreign languages. When he was only 11, he was the
          assistant organist, and not too long after that, composed his first
          piece. In March of 1787, Beethoven went to study with a very famous
          composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. However, Beethoven’s mother, Maria
          Magdalena Keverich, became ill, so he needed to return home. Just 5
          years later, his father also passed. At the age of 22, Motzart passed
          away. He became the pupil of the Austrian composer, Joseph Haydn, and
          studied with other famous composers.

          In around 1796, Beethoven started losing his hearing. At age 28, he
          composed his first symphony. It was Symphony no. 1 in C Major. Soon
          after that, he composed his second symphony, which was in D major. In
          1800, he performed some of his best compositions in Vienna. Starting
          that day, he composed many famous compositions that we know today. For
          example, in 1801, Beethoven composed the Moonlight Sonata (op.27
          no.2). This is one of the most famous sonatas in classical music. The
          piece has three movements: Adagio sostenuto, Allegretto, and Presto
          agitato. The piece starts off with a spooky movement, then gets
          playful in the second movement, and the third movement is very
          intense. The third movement is the most famous. In 1804, he composed
          the Third Symphony, often known as the “Eroica”. This was one of his
          longest symphonies (behind the fabulous ninth). In 1808, he composed
          the fifth symphony. It is most known for its first four-note opening.
          In 1810, he composed Für Elise. This piece was dedicated to his
          friend, Therese Malfatti. His handwriting was so messy that people
          thought the “T” was an “E”, thus the name. So the title should have
          been “Für Therese”.

          By 1818, he became completely deaf. He stopped playing music in
          public, and only composed by himself. When people tried to talk to
          him, they thought they were ignored, but it was just that Beethoven
          couldn’t hear them. In 1822, he started composing the fabulous ninth
          symphony. This was Beethoven’s final symphony, op. 125, known as Ode
          to Joy, from Friedrich Schiller's poem "Ode to Joy". This piece has
          four movements, Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso, Molto vivace,
          Adagio molto e cantabile, and the Finale. The last movement has the
          most famous theme. It has a chorus, and 4 solos: soprano,
          mezzo-soprano, tenor, and base. He finished in 1824 while being deaf
          throughout. He died in Vienna on March 26, 1827. Beethoven was a
          German composer who composed many famous pieces, such as the Moonlight
          Sonata, the Ninth Symphony, Fur Elise, and more. In 1824, he finished
          composing the Ninth symphony. It is a choral symphony and is the last
          symphony made by Beethoven.
